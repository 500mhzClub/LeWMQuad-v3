# Current research brief

The authoritative reference is [LeWMQuad-v3 agent brief: navigation testbed and controller capability, 25 September 2026](go2_navigation_testbed_controller_capability_agent_brief_2026-09-25.md).

It supersedes the decision-headroom programme. V4.2 is closed; its recommended study-design revision is not pursued. Follow the new brief's authorised scope, gates, budgets and stop conditions. Earlier protocols and results remain historical records.

## Active goal — explicitly started 25 September 2026

**Programme goal:** determine when JEPA representations carry decision-relevant information for navigation beyond kinematic prediction, reactive control and explicit memory. Start with a validated testbed, then the E1 benchmark, then moving obstacles. E1 execution and moving obstacles require separate approval.

**Current goal:** establish a validated Go2 simulation navigation testbed. For each controller type (C0 oracle, C1 command history, C2 reactive, C3 JEPA, C4 supervised predictor), determine whether it completes beacon retrieval and return in unseen mazes, report against the pre-registered capability criterion, and produce one example video per controller (C0 optional under the brief).

**Status:** V1 completed 5/10 round trips and 9/10 beacons, zero safety violations; all 20 startup-output checks pass. The [leg-specific diagnosis](go2_navigation_capability_paired_floor_leg_diagnosis_2026-09-27.md) finds three return timeouts, one outbound timeout and one return pose loss; return maps persist and there is no return re-exploration. V2 is frozen at `bad3883a` and its unchanged ten-episode C1 screen is running: retire an attained but unsuccessful visual-recovery reference after one second of continuous accepted-pose alignment. Tracker estimation, safety gates and the 480-second mission budget are unchanged. This is the third of six outcome versions. Budget projection including this screen is 94.64/160 hours with 15% contingency; storage fits. Oracle gate and capability qualification remain unstarted.

This replaces the 7 September navigation goal and the closed decision-headroom programme; neither is to be resumed. Machine-readable active-goal state is in [go2_navigation_capability_active_goal_2026-09-25.json](go2_navigation_capability_active_goal_2026-09-25.json). The thread goal tool refuses to replace its unfinished legacy goal; it must not be falsely marked achieved to bypass that limitation. This repository record is the current task tracker.

The completed diagnostic screen and current indexing/containment work are recorded in [the grid-correction progress report](go2_navigation_capability_grid_c3_progress_2026-09-26.md). Earlier interim reports remain historical records.


**Completed additional check (20/20 passed; five normal recordings exact):** after the unchanged C1 screen, execute the [startup-output contract](go2_navigation_capability_paired_floor_output_contract_plan_2026-09-26.json) on all 20 development starts, with numerical tolerance frozen from the old primary-path calibration before V1 comparisons. Compare complete 00/03/04/05/07 recordings with C3. Any failed or unresolved start must be reported before further changes. The current version also changes normal-start initialisation, so its charge stands regardless of the conditional correctness exemption.
