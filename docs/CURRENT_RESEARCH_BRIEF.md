# Current research brief

The authoritative reference is [LeWMQuad-v3 agent brief: navigation testbed and controller capability, 25 September 2026](go2_navigation_testbed_controller_capability_agent_brief_2026-09-25.md).

It supersedes the decision-headroom programme. V4.2 is closed; its recommended study-design revision is not pursued. Follow the new brief's authorised scope, gates, budgets and stop conditions. Earlier protocols and results remain historical records.

## Active goal — explicitly started 25 September 2026

**Programme goal:** determine when JEPA representations carry decision-relevant information for navigation beyond kinematic prediction, reactive control and explicit memory. Start with a validated testbed, then the E1 benchmark, then moving obstacles. E1 execution and moving obstacles require separate approval.

**Current goal:** establish a validated Go2 simulation navigation testbed. For each controller type (C0 oracle, C1 command history, C2 reactive, C3 JEPA, C4 supervised predictor), determine whether it completes beacon retrieval and return in unseen mazes, report against the pre-registered capability criterion, and produce one example video per controller (C0 optional under the brief).

**Status:** active; pre-registration and all maze sets are committed. The first oracle pilot has passed native round-trip and safety checks; the throughput pilot and fixed C4 fit are in progress. The user's kick-off explicitly authorizes sections 4–9 and the ordered work, including the oracle prefix check, throughput/concurrency pilot and early replay-video pipeline test. Controller failures are recorded results, not automatic programme stops. Stop at the brief's stated limits or after the final capability report, videos and E1 proposal.

This replaces the 7 September navigation goal and the closed decision-headroom programme; neither is to be resumed. Machine-readable active-goal state is in [go2_navigation_capability_active_goal_2026-09-25.json](go2_navigation_capability_active_goal_2026-09-25.json). The thread goal tool refuses to replace its unfinished legacy goal; it must not be falsely marked achieved to bypass that limitation. This repository record is the current task tracker.
