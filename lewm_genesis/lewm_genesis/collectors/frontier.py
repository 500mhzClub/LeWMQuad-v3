"""Privileged frontier teacher (data spec §13 — 20% share).

Drives the agent toward the *least-visited* reachable cell, biased to cells
that are farther away on the graph. Visit counts are kept per env so the
frontier signal stays coherent within an episode and bleeds gently across
episodes for the same env (useful for the loop-closure curriculum).

Reuses the route-teacher's bearing-to-primitive mapping; the only behavioural
difference is goal selection.
