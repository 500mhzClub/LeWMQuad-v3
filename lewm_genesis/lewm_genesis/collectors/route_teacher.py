"""Privileged route teacher (data spec §13 — 30% share).

Picks an unclaimed beacon goal per episode, computes a safe path with A*
on an inflated configuration-space grid (see
:class:`lewm_worlds.planning_grid.InflatedOccupancyGrid`), then follows
the path with a pure-pursuit primitive controller. Replans whenever the
current beacon is claimed, the robot deviates from the planned path, or
a periodic replan timer fires.

The grid-based planner replaces an earlier mix of room-cell BFS plus
several stacking heuristics (stuck FSM, off-center recenter, beacon
force-yaw, smoothed-waypoint LOS skip). The new design's invariant: if
A* returns a path, every cell on it has body-radius clearance, so the
follower never has to compensate for "the planner picked an unsafe
waypoint" — and the heuristics that used to mask graph-construction
bugs are no longer needed.
