"""Deterministic corpus planning with split- and family-disjoint seeds.

The planner converts a desired per-split, per-family scene count into a flat,
reproducible list of ``(split, family, scene_seed)`` assignments. Seeds are
derived by hashing ``(plan_seed, split, family, index, salt)``, so two splits
never share a topology seed even if their family counts overlap. ``salt`` is
0 by default; when scene-reachability validation is enabled, the planner
increments the salt until the scene passes ``audit_scene_reachability``,
keeping plan generation deterministic without inheriting unusable seeds.
