"""Reachability validation for generated scenes.

The route teacher plans on the configuration-space inflated grid (see
:mod:`lewm_worlds.planning_grid`). A scene is *valid for mass data
generation* iff every random spawn pose can navigate to every beacon —
otherwise the rollout produces episodes whose ground-truth solution
depends on which disconnected free-space component the spawn happened
to land in.

This module exposes a single audit function used both by the corpus
builder (to retry seeds that produce fragmented scenes) and by tests
(to assert that planning-grid-based collectors see solvable scenes).
