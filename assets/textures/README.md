# Scene textures (CC0)

Diffuse (albedo) color maps applied to floor / wall / obstacle surfaces at
render time (`lewm_genesis/textures.py` + `scene_builder.py`). Landmarks and
visual-stress distractors are intentionally **not** textured — their solid
colors are task identity / decoys.

## License

All textures here are from **ambientCG** (https://ambientcg.com) and are

Only the `*_Color.jpg` (1K) map of each material is vendored; other PBR maps
(normal/roughness/AO/displacement) were dropped — the pipeline is diffuse-only.
