"""Sketched-Isotropic-Gaussian Regularizer (SIGReg).

Ported verbatim from LeWMQuad-v2. Enforces latent embeddings to match an
isotropic Gaussian N(0, I) by:
1. Projecting embeddings onto M random unit-norm directions (Cramér-Wold)
2. Computing the Epps-Pulley normality test statistic on each 1-D projection
3. Averaging over all projections
